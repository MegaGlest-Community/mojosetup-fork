This repository by assumption is:
- a git type,
- doesn't contain whole commit history and "examples" from the upstream,
- may be slightly modified (tiny fixes),
- may be sometimes not up to date.

If you are looking for upstream which is a Mercurial repository,
go to the [Original Repository](https://hg.icculus.org/icculus/mojosetup/)
